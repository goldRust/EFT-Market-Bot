# EFT-Market-Bot
This bot would buy items on the EFT market and sell them to vendors.

I built this to learn more about how Tesseract OCR worked. It became a much more complex project than I originally intended, but it was a worthwhile learning experience.

Originally it was designed to monitor the price of one item on the Escape from Tarkov market, using screenshots and Tesseract OCR to determine the price. 
I expanded the bot by adding a list of items to monitor, buy if they were at the right price, then sell to the vendor once the designated inventory was full.
At it's best, this bot generated about 150k Roubles (in game currency) per hour. Left running for a long period, it ended up generating quite an in game fortune.

For better or worse, EFT incorporated a captcha system which has made this particular bot useless. Still, I learned a lot about Tesseract and bot development.
